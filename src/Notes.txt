                        **** Destructuring principle to avoid misalignments when passing values between functions **********

    - when passing values back and forth it is better to use objects {}, than arry[]
    - but with object, variables names have to be the same, so order in which they are passed does not matter
    - with array, values are passed based on position or order in the array, so name do not matter


      ************************************Errors************************
      ++Cannot destructure property 'method' of '_ref' as it is undefined.
          - it means properties of destructure object is does not have a value --> simply assign initial value
